| OPEN|BERKLEY README |

| OVERVIEW |
Open|Berkley is an Open Source recreation of the video game Shenmue, developed
by SEGA AM2, published by SEGA Corporation.  The goal of the project is to
emulate the original game.  All assets and code will be created via observing
the source material, nothing from the original game will be used directly in
this emulation.

There are a few sub-goals of this project:
Sub-Goal #1
* Using current personal computer hardware, attempt to fully realise the world
  of Shenmue in as much detail as possible

Sub-Goal #2
* Make the game available on as many hardware platforms as possible, with the
  restriciton being that the platform needs to produce 3D polygons

There is a high chance of this project receiving a cease and desist order if
the copyright holder of the original work (SEGA Corporation) deems it
necessary.  The owners of the project fully realise and respect the copyright
holder's ultimate authority over the protection of their intellectual property.

| PLATFORMS SUPPORTED |

* Linux
* Microsoft Windows
* DragonBox Pyra
